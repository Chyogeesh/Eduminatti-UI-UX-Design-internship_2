It is an internship assignment
Design Concept
Objective: Create a mobile-friendly infographic page for Eduminatti’s “Schools in Dehradun” section, showcasing top schools with easy navigation, filters, and engaging visuals.

Aspect Ratio: 375x812px (mobile view, iPhone 12/13).
Color Scheme: Blue (#005BBB) for trust, White (#FFFFFF) for clarity, Yellow (#FFC107) for CTAs, inspired by educational branding trends.
Typography: Roboto (clean, modern sans-serif) for headings (bold, 24-32px) and body text (regular, 16-18px).
Content Sections (based on Eduminatti’s page):
Hero Banner: Highlight Dehradun as the “School Capital of India” with a search bar.
Filters: Dropdowns for curriculum (CBSE, ICSE, IB), type (boarding, day), and gender (co-ed, boys, girls).
School Listings: Cards with school name, image, key details (fees, curriculum), and a “View Details” CTA.
Testimonials: Carousel of user reviews (e.g., Shalini, Nakul, Shivam).
CTA Section: Encourage users to contact counselors or register schools.
UX Principles:
Navigation: Sticky header with a hamburger menu for easy access.
Interactivity: Tappable filter buttons and school cards for quick exploration.
Visual Hierarchy: Bold headings, concise text, and high-quality images (sourced from Unsplash/Pixabay) for engagement.
Inspiration: Eduminatti’s focus on trust, ease of use, and comprehensive school data (,,).
Figma Design Process
Set Up Figma:
Create a new Figma project.
Add a frame with dimensions 375x812px (iPhone 12/13).
Use a grid (8px spacing) for alignment.
Design Components:
Header: Sticky bar (Blue, #005BBB) with logo (text-based “Eduminatti”), hamburger menu icon, and search icon.
Hero Banner: Full-width image (Unsplash: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523050854058-8df90110c9f1) with a semi-transparent overlay, bold heading (“Top Schools in Dehradun”), and a search bar (rounded, White background).
Filters: Horizontal scrollable chips (CBSE, ICSE, IB, Boarding, Day, etc.) with Yellow borders when selected.
School Listings: Vertical stack of cards, each with a 100x100px school image, name (e.g., The Doon School), details (fees: ₹3-12L, curriculum: CBSE/IB), and a Yellow “View Details” button.
Testimonials: Carousel with user quotes (e.g., “Eduminatti helped me find the best school!” – Shivam) and star ratings.
CTA Section: Yellow button (“Contact Our Counselors”) and text (“List Your School with Us”).
Footer: Links to About, Contact, and Privacy Policy in Deep Blue.
Visual Elements:
Use Font Awesome icons (e.g., fa-search, fa-filter) for interactivity.
Source images from Unsplash or Pixabay (e.g., school campuses, classrooms).
Apply subtle shadows to cards for depth and rounded corners (8px) for a modern look.
Export:
Export the frame as a PNG, then convert to PDF using a tool like Canva or Adobe Acrobat.
Share the Figma project link (set to “Anyone with the link can view”) in the submission email.
HTML/CSS Representation
Below is the HTML/CSS code representing the Figma design, which can be used to prototype the layout or guide the Figma implementation. This ensures the design is mobile-optimized and aligns with Eduminatti’s content.
